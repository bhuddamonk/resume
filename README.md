# resume
Using various frameworks and add ons to build my resume site.

1. Bootstrap for the grid framework.
2. Particles.js for the opening splash screen.
3. TBD to do the dynamic round progress bars.
4. Embedded Resume into Slick.js carousel.

Will also add some dynamic google maps to denote places worked.
